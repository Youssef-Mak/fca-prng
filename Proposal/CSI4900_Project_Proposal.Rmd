# Objective

The main goal of the project is gather insight on the generation of pseudorandom numbers using Fuzzy Cellular Automata(FCA). 

This includes:

- **Implementation Feasibility**: details of implementation, potential drawbacks, robustness.
- **Algorithmic Complexity**: efficiency, optimizations, performance bottlenecks.
- **Quality of Randomness**: performance in Diehard tests, comparison with existing pseudo-number generators.

## Tentative Side Objective

We can also attempt to find more details of the relationship between FCA and BCA, more specifically, how does the randomness of a FCA relate to the randomness of its corresponding BCA, according to a set of randomness 
criteria. [2]

# Rough Approach

1. Select subset of BCA Rules to be studied. 

2. Implement and Apply Fuzzification Algorithm [1] to selected rules.
   i. Evaluate potential optimizations

3. Extract outputs and perform randomness study.
   i. Define output to be used as Random Number (ie. the equivalent of the centre columns in the Rule 30 generator [3])
   ii. Extract statistically significant output (ie. number of iterations, number of generations per rule)

4. Evaluate Quality of Randomness.

## Tentative Steps

5. Extract outputs from equivalent BCA and Evaluate Quality of Randomness

6. Identify relationship between BCA and its fuzzified counterpart(ie. is the randomness of a BCA the same as its fuzzified equivalent?)
   i. Apply Diehard tests
   ii. Apply BCA Randomness criteria [2]
